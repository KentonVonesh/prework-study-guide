# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This website is a study guide to help log information and notes I accumulate over the course of the bootcamp. It solves the problem of me having a large amount of information being given to me while having no place to store it. While creating this webpage I learned basic fundamentals about HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

## Usage

The study guide can be used to take notes and it already contains notes on multiple topics. If you open the console in Chrome DevTools you can see the JavaScript running and it will list the topics I learned in the prework and will give a random topic to study.
